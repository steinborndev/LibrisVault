/**
 * GET /api/v1/events — the Server-Sent Events stream that drives the live dashboard
 * (SPEC.md §6.5, TASKS-M3 §1). It is the spine of the UI: every job transition, every
 * agent log line, and a "stats changed" hint are pushed here so the browser never polls
 * for the DoD's live log.
 *
 * Transport notes:
 *  - `text/event-stream`, one JSON payload per `data:` line, `event:` = the bus event kind.
 *  - At most MAX_STREAMS_PER_CLIENT streams per client address (429 beyond), so one visitor
 *    cannot pin the process with an unbounded number of open sockets.
 *  - A heartbeat comment (`: ping`) every 15 s keeps intermediaries and the browser from
 *    dropping an idle connection, and lets us detect a dead socket to unsubscribe.
 *  - On disconnect we unsubscribe from the bus and clear the heartbeat — no listener leak
 *    (CLAUDE.md: clean unsubscribe on disconnect).
 *  - On SHUTDOWN we end them ourselves, from a `preClose` hook. A hijacked response is a
 *    connection that by design never completes, and `app.close()` waits for every connection
 *    to end before it resolves: with one dashboard tab open the service logged "shutting
 *    down" and then sat there forever, needing a SIGKILL. `preClose` is the one hook that
 *    runs BEFORE the server starts waiting, which is what makes this the right place for it
 *    rather than `onClose`.
 *
 * SSE cannot set an Authorization header, so in the future `token` auth mode this route
 * would need a query-param token; v1 ships only `local-single-user` (pass-through), so the
 * standard auth hook already lets it through.

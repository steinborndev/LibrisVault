/**
 * Maintenance runs (SPEC.md §6.4, TASKS-M4 §2): lint, autoresearch, hot-cache refresh. Each
 * is a vault-mutating agent run, so — unlike chat — it goes through the SAME commit
 * discipline as ingest: a shared commit mutex (one writer) and a per-run commit. Progress is
 * streamed live to the dashboard over the event bus under a stable per-kind channel id
 * (`maintenance:lint` etc.), which the Wartung tab renders as a live log.
 *
 * Runs are ASYNC/job-style (TASKS-M5 §0): `start*()` registers a run, kicks it off in the
 * background and returns a `runId` immediately — the HTTP request is NOT held for the (up to
 * 15-min) agent run, so a slow or stuck lint can no longer wedge the request or a worker. The
 * caller polls `getRun(id)` for the result while watching the live log on the bus channel.
 * A stuck run is now bounded by the agent runner's hard, group-level kill (Finding F1).
 *
 * Profiles (permissions.ts): lint + hot-cache use `ingest` (write, no web); autoresearch
 * uses `research` (write AND web egress — the one flow allowed the web, CLAUDE.md hard rule 4).

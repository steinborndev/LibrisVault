/**
 * The ingestion queue and worker pool (SPEC.md §3.1, §3.2). The `jobs` table is the
 * single source of truth; this class is the engine that drives rows through it:
 *
 *   queued → preprocessing → ingesting → done | failed | deferred
 *
 * Responsibilities (TASKS-M1 §2):
 *   - a worker pool of default concurrency 2 (SPEC.md §3.1)
 *   - preprocessing via the plugin chain, then a headless agent ingest run
 *   - up to 2 automatic retries on transient errors, then `failed` (SPEC.md §3.1)
 *   - pause on a usage-limit signal, auto-resume (SPEC.md §7.1) — a pause never burns a retry
 *   - persist the agent stream to job_logs (SPEC.md §3.1)
 *   - one git commit per successful ingest (TASKS-M1 §0)
 *
 * Every external effect (agent run, git, tool detection, timers) is injectable so the
 * logic is unit-testable without a real SDK, a real vault, or the toolchain.

   *
   *   - An `ingesting` run whose final log entry is already in `wiki/log.md` had FINISHED writing;
   *     only its commit and status update were lost to the crash → commit its dirty pages and flip
   *     to `done`.
   *   - An `ingesting` run with NO completion marker was genuinely mid-write → still commit the
   *     pages it had already written (see below), then mark `failed` (retryable). A `preprocessing`
   *     job never reached the agent and wrote nothing → `failed`, no commit.
   *
   * Both `ingesting` cases commit the dirty wiki pages (via commitPaths — an explicit pathspec,
   * never `git add -A`, so nothing outside this run is swept in), differing only in the resulting
   * STATUS. The marker decides whether the JOB is done, not whether its on-disk pages get
   * versioned: committing a not-completed run's pages is what stops the RETRY from orphaning them
   * (its `dirtyBefore` snapshot would otherwise exclude them from the F4 sweep, and no later pass
   * ever picks them up — the 2026-07-23 retry-orphan bug). Committing happens BEFORE the status
   * flip, so a second crash mid-reconcile re-enters here (still `ingesting`) rather than stranding
   * a terminal job with uncommitted pages.
   *
   * Residual risk (SPEC §11.3 risk 5): the dirty-wiki set can, in principle, include a page the
   * user was editing in Obsidian at restart, which would then land in the recovered commit. It
   * only fires when a crash left an ingest's pages uncommitted, and the page stays fully versioned
   * and revertable — strictly better than orphaning it, or than the old `git add -A` sweeping it

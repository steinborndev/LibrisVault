 *
 *  - **Code.** `tf.constant([[1.]] * n)` is a Python literal, not a link to a page named
 *    "1." - and a lint report quoting `[[Some Page]]` is not linking to it. Code is stripped
 *    first (the validator used to do this on its own; it belongs here, for every caller).
 *  - **Escaped pipes.** Inside a markdown table the alias separator MUST be written `\|` or
 *    the cell breaks, so comparison tables are full of `[[Compound Interest\|CI]]`. Splitting
 *    on the bare `|` leaves the escape in the page name, and the link resolves to nothing -

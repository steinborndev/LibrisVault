 * The live-update event bus (SPEC.md §6.5, TASKS-M3 §1) — the spine of the dashboard's
 * SSE stream. The `JobStore` publishes a `job` event on every state transition and a
 * `log` event on every `job_logs` append; the queue publishes `stats` when vault-visible
 * numbers change (a commit landed). The SSE route is the only subscriber in-process.
 *
 * This is a notification channel, NOT a source of truth: the `jobs`/`job_logs` tables
 * remain authoritative (hard rule 1). A dropped or missed event only costs a client a
 * slightly stale view until its next poll/reconnect — it can never corrupt state. Keeping
 * it in-memory (no persistence, no backpressure) is therefore deliberate.

# TASKS-RETRIEVE — hybrid retrieval for query & research (vault `wiki-retrieve` skill)

Goal: replace the page-granular `hot → index → pages` query read path with the vault's shipped
chunk-level retrieval stack (`skills/wiki-retrieve`: contextual prefix + BM25 + optional cosine
rerank), provisioned and kept fresh by the service. **Acceptance: with the index provisioned, a
chat question whose answer lives in a single passage of a page whose TITLE does not match the
question is answered correctly with the right citation; the query run's log shows a
`retrieve.py` invocation; the index is rebuilt automatically after ingests with no manual
action; with the egress setting off, no vault content leaves the machine during index builds;
`npm test` green.**

Post-M5 extension — the milestone gate does not apply, but the working agreement does: work top
to bottom, check off as completed, record decisions under "Findings". Staged rollout is part of
the design: Stage 1 (BM25-only, zero new dependencies) must be live and accepted before Stage 2
(ollama rerank), and Stage 2 before Stage 3 (LLM contextual prefixes, egress-gated).

## 0. Spec & rules amendment — DONE (user sign-off 2026-07-23)

- [x] SPEC.md: new **§12.6 "Hybrides Retrieval auf Chunk-Ebene"** — three stages (each gated on
      the previous one's acceptance), the deterministic-pipeline-step clarification, the
      no-versioning decision, and the freshness contract (debounced `retrieve-index` run,
      manual `POST /api/v1/maintenance/retrieve-index`).
- [x] CLAUDE.md hard rule 1: sanctioned exception added (2026-07-23, references SPEC.md §12.6) —
      pipeline code may run the vault's own deterministic index scripts as child processes for
      the derived `.vault-meta/{chunks,bm25,embed-cache.json}` artifacts only; wiki content
      stays agent-run-only.
- [x] Decided & verified: index artifacts stay OUT of vault git history via
      `VAULT_ROOT/.git/info/exclude` (repo-local, hard rule 5 safe). Verified against REAL git
      (see Findings F-R1): both the pathspec staging (`BOOKKEEPING_PATHS` stages `.vault-meta`
      on EVERY commit) and the legacy `git add -A` path skip excluded untracked files, and
      `git status --untracked-files=all` (the `dirtyPaths` F4 bracketing) does not list them.

## 1. Indexer plumbing (`pipeline/retrieve-index.ts`) — DONE 2026-07-23

- [x] New module `pipeline/retrieve-index.ts` wrapping the vault scripts as child processes
      (no LLM, no agent run): `buildRetrieveIndex()` runs `python3 scripts/contextual-prefix.py
      --all` (NO `--allow-egress` ⇒ tier-3 synthetic prefix; credentials additionally STRIPPED
      from the child env as belt-and-braces, F-R2) then `python3 scripts/bm25-index.py build`.
      cwd = `VAULT_ROOT`, timeouts 15 min / 5 min, `shell: false`, non-zero exit ⇒ typed error
      with a stderr tail, never crashes the service.
- [x] Provisioning folded into the first build (simpler than a separate path): every
      `buildRetrieveIndex()` idempotently writes the `.git/info/exclude` entries and creates
      `.vault-meta/{chunks,bm25}/` before running — the POST is provision-if-needed. The
      interactive `bin/setup-retrieve.sh` is deliberately NOT shelled out to (consent prompt
      would hang headless).
- [x] Feature detection `isRetrieveProvisioned()` mirroring the skill's canonical check, plus
      `hasRetrieveScripts()` (pre-v1.7 clone → `RetrieveScriptsMissingError` → 409 at the route,
      checked synchronously before a run is registered).
- [x] Freshness: new maintenance kind `retrieve-index` on the `MaintenanceRunner` — the one
      DETERMINISTIC kind: no agent, no credential (works in setup mode), no commit, tracked in
      the same run map/poll routes as agent runs, live log on `maintenance:retrieve-index`.
      Deviation from the sketch, recorded as F-R3: it takes NEITHER the run mutex NOR the
      commit mutex — its own `indexMutex` serializes builds against each other only.
      Triggered (a) manually via `POST /api/v1/maintenance/retrieve-index` (202, not gated on
      the credential), (b) by `startRetrieveIndexScheduler` in main.ts: job `done` events reset
      a quiet window (default 5 min), one rebuild per window, provisioning checked at FIRE time
      so the first manual build arms the automation without a restart.
- [x] Stats: `GET /api/v1/maintenance/retrieve-index` → `{ scriptsPresent, provisioned,
      chunkCount, indexBuiltAt }` (cheap fs walk; last build outcome/duration comes from the
      run history like every other kind). Active-tier display deferred to §3 where a second
      tier first exists.
- [x] Tests (`test/retrieve-index.test.ts`, 17 tests): exclude idempotence + append-to-existing
      + no-git no-op; detection lifecycle; builder order/args/no-egress-flag, chunk count,
      missing-scripts + failing-script errors; scheduler debounce burst→1, window reset,
      non-done/unprovisioned inertia, close-cancels, throwing-start contained; runner kind
      settles done/error, fires `onRunSettled`, throws synchronously without scripts,
      serializes concurrent builds. Suite: 531 tests / 39 files green; typecheck + lint clean.

## 2. Stage 1 — BM25-only query path — DONE 2026-07-23

- [x] `querySystemPrompt(vaultRoot)` in `pipeline/system-prompt.ts` resolves the read path per
      run: provisioned ⇒ "run `python3 scripts/retrieve.py "<question>" --top 5 --no-rerank`
      first, read ONLY the candidates, fall back to the legacy order if it fails"; unprovisioned
      ⇒ the legacy prompt byte-for-byte (`QUERY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` kept as that constant). Wired in
      `agent-runner.ts` (`profile === 'query'` branch). `--no-rerank` pinned — stage 1 adds no
      ollama dependency and no cache writes, so the read-only query sandbox is untouched.
- [x] Live verify — the retrieval mechanism runs and the sandbox allows it (see F-R5). The
      real vault provisioned to **859 chunks** via `POST /maintenance/retrieve-index`;
      `retrieve.py --no-rerank` returns valid JSON (`strategy: bm25-only`, 20 BM25 hits →
      top-5 candidates with `absolute_path`), exit 0. `python3` + unrestricted reads under the
      `query` profile were already M0-validated, so the sandbox permits the call.
- [x] Baseline + comparison measured on the live vault (F-R6). Recorded under Findings; the
      honest read is that single-shot `tokensIn` is confounded by prompt-cache dominance and is
      NOT a clean receipt — cost fell on all three questions, but the real value case rests on
      retrieval quality, which needs the mid-page/title-mismatch acceptance question (§7), not
      token counting.
- [ ] Research/autoresearch: no code change expected — `autoresearch` feature-detects the skill
      itself. Verify one research run picks it up (log evidence). *(Deferred to the next research
      run — not exercised in this pass; the query path was the §2 focus.)*
- [x] Tests: `querySystemPrompt` emits the retrieval block iff provisioned, legacy byte-for-byte
      otherwise, `--no-rerank` present, read-only contract preserved (`test/retrieve-index.test.ts`,
      +2 tests → 533 total green; typecheck + lint clean; server rebuilt + service restarted).

## 3. Stage 2 — cosine rerank, SERVICE-SIDE — DONE 2026-07-23

**Redesigned before implementation (F-R9, user decision): the two sandbox exceptions this
section originally called for are NOT needed and were NOT made.** Retrieval moved out of the
agent entirely — the service runs `retrieve.py` itself, before the agent starts, and hands the
agent ranked PAGES on the prompt. The read-only `query` profile is byte-for-byte unchanged.

- [x] ~~Embed-cache warmup / sandbox `allowWrite` exception~~ — **not needed.** `rerank.py`
      writes `.vault-meta/embed-cache.json` at query time and always will (the cache key is
      `model:body_hash`, so the QUERY embedding is a guaranteed miss every time — warmup cannot
      remove it). Since retrieval now runs in the service process, that write is simply an
      ordinary service write to derived, git-excluded state, exactly like the index build.
- [x] ~~Sandbox localhost/network exception for ollama~~ — **not made, and must not be.** The
      ollama API is UNAUTHENTICATED and far wider than "embed this string": `/api/pull` fetches
      models from the internet, `/api/create`/`/api/delete` mutate them, `/api/generate` runs
      inference. Opening it to a sandboxed run would hand a prompt-injected agent an indirect
      egress channel — precisely what the no-egress profile exists to prevent. The service talks
      to ollama; the sandbox never does.
- [x] `retrieveCandidates()` (`pipeline/retrieve-index.ts`): runs `python3 scripts/retrieve.py
      "<q>" --top N` via the same injectable `ProcessRunner` seam as the index build; parses
      STDOUT ONLY (stderr carries "bm25: N hits", F-R5); collapses multi-chunk hits to their
      page keeping best rank; caps the question at 1000 chars before argv; returns
      `{candidates, strategy}` and degrades to empty on ANY failure (unprovisioned, script
      error, bad JSON) — a query must never fail because retrieval did.
- [x] Prompt: `QUERY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is static again (no `retrieve.py` instruction at all) and
      names both read paths; per-question hits render as a `<retrieved_context>` block appended
      to the question (`renderRetrievalBlock`). Ranked starting point, explicitly NOT an
      exclusive whitelist — a hard "only these" would turn a retrieval miss into a false "not in
      the vault" answer.
- [x] `runQuery` performs retrieval then calls `runAgent`; `onRetrieval` callback lets the route
      log the engaged tier. Retriever injectable so tests never spawn python.
- [x] Graceful degradation: ollama down ⇒ `retrieve.py` returns `noop-no-ollama` and falls back
      to BM25 order (verified via `rerank.py --peek` before install); retrieval failure ⇒ empty
      block ⇒ legacy read path. The query neither fails nor hangs.
- [x] Ops: ollama installed userspace (no sudo on this host) as systemd --user
      `ollama.service`, loopback-only, lingering on. See F-R10.
- [x] Tests (+11 → 544 green): `retrieveCandidates` ranking/dedupe/argv-shape/truncation/three
      degradation paths; prompt has no `retrieve.py` and renders empty for no hits; `runQuery`
      appends the block, leaves the question untouched on empty, and — the load-bearing one —
      asserts the run still carries `sandbox.enabled === true` and
      `allowUnsandboxedCommands === false` with the static system prompt.
- [x] Sandbox-unchanged proof: `permissions.ts` untouched (`git diff --quiet`), and the
      `agent-runner.ts` diff contains no `sandbox`/`network`/`allowWrite`/`allowUnsandboxed`/
      `WEB_TOOLS`/`disallowedTools` line — only the prompt-constant swap. **No permprobe run was
      required because no permission wiring changed** (hard rule 4 triggers on SDK upgrades and
      permission-wiring changes; this was neither).
- [x] Live: the §7 acceptance question answered correctly with the exact figures and 4
      citations; journal shows `[query] retrieval: 5 page(s),
      strategy=bm25+rerank:cosine:nomic-embed-text`.

## 3b. Findings from the stage-2 redesign

- **F-R9 (2026-07-23) — the sandbox exceptions were an artifact of the §2 design, not a
  requirement of retrieval.** §2 shipped "the agent runs `retrieve.py` itself", which dragged
  everything the script needs *into* the read-only sandbox (ollama network + embed-cache write).
  Moving the call into the SERVICE removes both needs at zero cost to sandbox strictness — and
  is strictly better on two other axes: (1) retrieval becomes DETERMINISTIC (the agent no longer
  decides whether to retrieve, which was the F-R7 variance problem), and (2) it reuses the
  §12.6-sanctioned "service runs the vault's deterministic scripts" mechanism already used for
  the index build. Lesson worth keeping: when a capability seems to require loosening a
  boundary, check whether the work can move to the trusted side of it instead.
- **F-R10 (2026-07-23) — ollama install notes (this host).** No passwordless sudo, so the
  official `curl | sudo sh` installer is unusable here. Installed userspace instead: the release
  asset format changed to `.tar.zst` (the old `ollama.com/download/*.tgz` endpoint now 404s),
  and no `zstd` binary exists on the host, so extraction went through the pip `zstandard` module
  into `~/.local` (bin+lib siblings — the binary finds `../lib/ollama` on its own). Runs as
  systemd --user `ollama.service` with `OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434` (loopback-only by
  construction, not just by default), enabled, lingering on so it survives a WSL restart like
  vault-service. Model: `nomic-embed-text` (274 MB), CPU-only is fast enough for one query
  embedding plus cached chunk embeddings.

## 3c. Check 1 — retrieval quality baseline (the stage-3 gate) — DONE 2026-07-23

Built before deciding on stage 3, because every quality claim so far was anecdotal (F-R6 was
confounded, F-R7 was n=1). Harness: `npm run retrieval-eval --workspace server -- --data <jsonl>`
(`src/cli/retrieval-eval.ts`), calling the SAME `retrieveCandidates` production uses, reporting
BM25-only vs BM25+rerank side by side with per-case ranks. The labeled set is 21 cases across 5
domains with a deliberate easy/medium/hard mix (hard = buried mid-page fact, paraphrase, or no
title-term overlap). **The dataset lives OUTSIDE this repo** (`~/.local/share/vault-service/
retrieval-eval.jsonl`) — its questions and expected paths are vault content (hard rule 7).

Result (21 cases, top-k 5):

| metric | BM25 only | BM25 + rerank |
|---|---|---|
| top-1 | 14/21 (67%) | 12/21 (57%) |
| top-5 | **20/21 (95%)** | 19/21 (90%) |
| missed | 1 | 2 |

- [x] **Stage 3 verdict: DO NOT BUILD** (F-R11). BM25 alone already puts the right page in the
      agent's top-5 in 95% of cases, so the entire headroom for contextual prefixes is ~1 case in
      21 — against real per-rebuild cost and the only egress path in the whole retrieval design.
      §4 below is kept for the record but is not planned work.
- [x] Secondary finding: the rerank stage does NOT pay for itself on this set (F-R12).

## 3d. Findings from check 1

- **F-R11 (2026-07-23) — the stage-3 gate closed the stage.** 95% top-5 on BM25 alone is the
  number that matters, because top-5 is exactly what the service hands the agent. The single
  BM25 miss (`bio-5`) is a deliberately brutal variant of the F-R7 question with both brand names
  removed. Paying per rebuild and sending page bodies off-machine to chase one case in 21 is a
  bad trade. Revisit only if the vault grows enough that a re-run of this harness shows top-5
  degrading.
- **F-R12 (2026-07-23) — rerank helps exactly what it should, and it does not show up in the
  metric that matters.** Per-case ranks: it improved 5 cases and worsened 6. But the improvements
  are concentrated where it was supposed to help — three HARD cases promoted to rank 1
  (`fin-2` 3→1, `fin-6` 3→1, `bio-2` 2→1) — while most regressions are cosmetic demotions of
  cases BM25 already had at rank 1 (1→2, 1→3), which are operationally invisible because the
  agent receives five pages either way. The one real regression is `cook-2` (rank 1 → out of
  top-5 entirely). Net on top-5: −1 case, i.e. within noise at n=21. Honest conclusion: **on
  current evidence rerank is neutral-to-slightly-negative in production terms** while adding an
  ollama dependency and per-query latency; the case for keeping it rests on the hard-case rank
  gains, not on hit rate. Decide with a bigger set rather than from this one — the harness now
  makes that cheap.
- **Methodological caveat, stated so nobody over-trusts these numbers:** the questions were
  written by reading the target pages, so some vocabulary leakage is unavoidable even in the
  cases built to avoid title terms. The stronger next iteration is to seed the set from REAL
  questions already in the chat sessions table, labeling them after the fact.
- **F-R13 (2026-07-23) — set expanded to 35 cases; the curated set was NOT flattering, and the
  rerank verdict hardened.** The intended next step (seed from real chat questions) turned out to
  be impossible: the `messages` table holds only 10 user rows, all of them this session's own
  test queries — the Research tab had never been used in earnest, so there is no unbiased
  question history yet. Instead the set was enlarged with a **blind random sample** of 14 content
  pages (`find | sort | seeded shuffle`, system/report pages excluded), one question each, to
  kill the cherry-picking bias specifically. Result over 35 cases:

  | metric | BM25 only | BM25 + rerank |
  |---|---|---|
  | top-1 | 24/35 (69%) | 19/35 (54%) |
  | top-5 | **34/35 (97%)** | 33/35 (94%) |
  | top-5 · curated (21) | 20/21 (95%) | 19/21 (90%) |
  | top-5 · random (14) | **14/14 (100%)** | 14/14 (100%) |

  - **The cohort split clears the bias worry:** the blind-random cohort scored *higher* (100%)
    than the curated one (95%), so the original numbers were if anything pessimistic — the
    curated set carried the deliberately brutal cases. The 95-97% baseline is real.
  - **Stage 3 is now definitively closed:** 97% top-5 on BM25 alone, and the single miss in the
    entire 35-case set is `bio-5`, the intentionally brand-name-stripped F-R7 variant. Headroom
    for contextual prefixes is ~1 case in 35, against per-rebuild cost and the design's only
    egress path.
  - **Rerank recommendation: turn it OFF in the production path.** At n=35 the top-1 gap is no
    longer noise (24→19, a 21% relative drop) and top-5 still costs one case. Per-case it
    improves 8 and worsens 10; the improvements do cluster on hard cases (four promoted to rank
    1) but the demotions land there too (`rnd-1` 1→4, `rnd-13` 1→2). Since the agent reads all
    five returned pages, rank movement *inside* the top-5 is largely invisible anyway — so what
    remains is a dependency and per-query latency for no measurable gain. Keep ollama and the
    code path; re-measure when the vault roughly doubles or if a stronger embedding model is
    worth a try. BM25's lexical matching is simply very strong at this vault size.

## 3e. Rerank disabled in production — DONE 2026-07-23

- [x] `retrieveCandidates` default flipped to `rerank = false` (one line + the comment that
      records WHY, pointing at F-R13). Test asserts both directions of the flag, so the default
      cannot drift back silently. Live: `[query] retrieval: … strategy=bm25-only`.
- [x] **ollama is no longer needed by the running service** and never was a declared dependency —
      it appears in no setup script, no `Dockerfile`, and no requirements list (verified by grep;
      only prose in README/SPEC/SECURITY plus code comments). Its systemd --user unit is now
      **stopped and disabled**; binary (~2.1 GB) and model (~262 MB) are kept on disk so a
      re-measurement needs one command: `systemctl --user start ollama.service`.
      Verified after stopping it: the query path answers normally at `strategy=bm25-only`.
- [x] **Benchmark guard added** (this is the trap the flip creates): with ollama down,
      `retrieve.py` silently reports `bm25+rerank:noop-no-ollama` and returns BM25 order, which
      would make the harness's rerank column a duplicate of the baseline and invite a wrong
      conclusion. `retrieval-eval` now THROWS when rerank was requested but the strategy carries
      no `cosine`, and prints each column's strategy label. Graceful degradation is right in
      production and wrong in a benchmark.
- [x] SPEC §12.6 corrected: stage 2 previously still described the localhost/network and
      embed-cache sandbox exceptions as planned work. They were never built and must not be —
      the text now records the service-side design, the unauthenticated-ollama-API reasoning,
      the default-off rerank with its measurement, and that ollama is not a service requirement.
      Stage 3 is marked NOT PLANNED with the reason. README updated to match.

## 4. Stage 3 — LLM contextual prefixes (egress, opt-in) — NOT PLANNED (see F-R11)

- [ ] New setting `retrievePrefixEgress` (default OFF) in `settings` (route + zod + UI toggle
      in `SettingsEditor`). Consent copy must say plainly: wiki page bodies are sent to the
      Anthropic API during index builds. This mirrors the vault's own `--allow-egress` gate —
      the service must not silently widen it.
- [ ] When ON, the index build passes `--allow-egress` and provides the credential to the
      script env (tier 1 needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; under OAuth-only auth tier 2 uses the
      `claude` CLI — verify which tier engages per auth mode, record here). Credential handling
      per hard rule 3: env only, never logged, never in SQLite.
- [ ] One-time `--rebuild` after first enable (synthetic prefixes ⇒ real prefixes), surfaced as
      an explicit button with the cost note (~$12 / 1,000 documents one-time, incremental
      after — from the skill's cost section).
- [ ] Tests: flag plumbing (egress flag reaches the process layer iff setting on), settings
      route validation, no credential in captured logs.

## 5. Dashboard (Maintenance tab) — DONE 2026-07-23

- [x] "Retrieval index" card (`web/src/tabs/Maintenance.tsx`, `RetrievalIndexCard`): three
      states off `GET /maintenance/retrieve-index` — scripts absent (pre-v1.7 vault → explains,
      no button), not provisioned (Build index button), provisioned (chunk count + built-at via
      `timeAgo`, Rebuild button). Rebuild uses `useMaintenanceRun(api.retrieveIndex)` with the
      live `maintenance:retrieve-index` JobLog; on settle it invalidates the status query. Placed
      left column after Hot cache. `api.retrieveIndexStatus`/`api.retrieveIndex` +
      `RetrieveIndexStatus` type + `MaintenanceKind` extension added to the web client.
      Active-tier display intentionally omitted until §3 adds a second tier. web typecheck +
      build clean; card verified present in the served bundle.
- [x] Chat: no UI change (same composer, same citation chips), as designed.

## 6. Docs — DONE 2026-07-23

- [x] README: new "Hybrid retrieval (optional)" subsection under the dashboard section — what it
      is, on-machine build, auto-rebuild after ingests, the Maintenance card, and a note that
      rerank + LLM prefixes are gated follow-ups (the latter the only off-machine step, default
      off). Maintenance-tab bullet + API list updated with the two `retrieve-index` endpoints.
- [x] SECURITY.md: operational-hardening bullet — index build is fully on-machine (never
      `--allow-egress`, credential stripped from the child env), derived data under `.vault-meta`
      excluded from git, and the planned stages' egress posture (loopback-only rerank; LLM
      prefixes behind an explicit default-off setting).

## 7. Live acceptance

- [x] Provision Stage 1 on the live vault: 859 chunks, ~1s (F-R5).
- [x] The headline acceptance question (answer mid-page, title mismatch) — **PASSED** (F-R7). A
      buried causal claim (a storage property of one product traced to a measured parameter of
      one of its components) whose source page title names none of the query terms: the retrieval path answered correctly with the exact quantitative values and cited
      both the source and the synthesis page (5 chips). The A/B against legacy is honest, not a
      clean win — see F-R7.
- [x] Post-ingest freshness — **PASSED live** (F-R8). A throwaway text-note ingest reached
      `done`; ~5 min later the debounced `retrieve-index` run fired on its own (0 → 1 runs,
      859 → 860 chunks, run settled `done`), no manual action. Test artifacts reverted from the
      vault afterwards (two `git revert` commits — the agent correctly created NO wiki page for a
      note it judged valueless, so only `.raw/` + `log.md` had to be undone).
- [x] Token/latency delta vs the §2 baseline recorded under Findings (F-R6) — confounded, not a
      receipt.
- [x] `npm test` green: 533 tests / 39 files. typecheck + lint clean.

## Findings

- **F-R1 (2026-07-23) — the exclude entries are load-bearing, not hygiene.** `BOOKKEEPING_PATHS`
  in `pipeline/git.ts` stages `.vault-meta` with EVERY vault commit, and `dirtyPaths` brackets
  runs with `git status --untracked-files=all`. Without the `.git/info/exclude` entries, every
  index rebuild would bleed into the next ingest/maintenance commit and pollute the F4 sweep.
  Verified against a real throwaway git repo: with the entries present, `git add -- .vault-meta`
  staged only a non-excluded file (`transport.json`), and `status --untracked-files=all` listed
  none of the index artifacts.
- **F-R2 (2026-07-23) — double egress lock on index builds.** Stage 1 never passes
  `--allow-egress` (the script's `pick_prefix_tier()` then returns synthetic regardless of
  credentials), AND the builder strips `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from the
  child env, so even a future vault version with different gating defaults could not phone home.
  §3 will relax exactly one of these, behind the explicit setting.
- **F-R3 (2026-07-23) — mutex decision.** `retrieve-index` runs on its own `indexMutex`, not the
  run mutex or commit mutex: it writes only excluded, untracked, derived artifacts (nothing to
  commit, nothing another writer could mis-attribute), and parking it behind a 15-min agent run
  would only delay freshness. A rebuild racing a concurrent ingest can at worst chunk a
  half-written page — self-healing, since that ingest's own `done` event schedules the next
  debounced rebuild.
- **F-R4 (2026-07-23) — run-registry wording in the §1 sketch was ambiguous.** The codebase has
  two "registries": `RunRegistry` (F4 sole-writer tracking) and the runner's in-memory run map
  (what the poll routes serve). `retrieve-index` uses only the latter — it never writes wiki
  content, so it must NOT count as a vault writer in `RunRegistry` (it would suppress the F4
  sweep of a genuinely sole agent writer).
- **F-R5 (2026-07-23) — mechanism verified end to end on the real vault.** Provisioning the live
  245-page vault produced **859 chunks** in ~1s (synthetic tier-3 prefix = title + first
  paragraph, pure string ops — the sub-second time is expected, not a bug). `.git/info/exclude`
  holds all three entries and `git status --untracked-files=all` lists none of the 859 chunk
  files / bm25 index (F-R1 confirmed live). `retrieve.py "<q>" --top 5 --no-rerank` returns
  well-formed JSON (`strategy: bm25-only`, "bm25: 20 hits" on stderr, 5 candidates each with
  `absolute_path`), exit 0. Gotcha for future probing: retrieve.py prints a progress line to
  STDERR, so `2>&1 | json` corrupts the parse — read stdout alone.
- **F-R6 (2026-07-23) — token A/B is confounded; cost fell modestly; quality is the real test.**
  Same 3 questions, legacy path (old build, index absent) vs retrieval path (provisioned), one
  shot each. tokensIn/tokensOut/costUSD/wall:
  - Q1: 132385/584/$0.3082/12.9s → 131973/489/**$0.1595**/11.1s (2 citations)
  - Q2: 166914/2730/$0.3386/31.3s → 251545/1948/**$0.2712**/34.9s (6 citations; tokensIn ROSE)
  - Q3: 129778/832/$0.1203/14.6s → 86089/291/**$0.0964**/9.3s (0 citations)
  `tokensIn` is dominated by prompt-cache reads of the system prompt + the vault's plugin/skill
  definitions (`skills: 'all'`), a ~100k+ floor that swamps the page-read difference and even
  moves the wrong way (Q2). Cost dropped on all three (output-token + non-cached-input driven),
  but with n=1 and that confound this is NOT a clean value receipt. The load-bearing evidence is
  the retrieval-quality acceptance question in §7 (answer in a mid-page passage of a
  title-mismatched page), which token counting cannot capture. Do NOT cite F-R6 as "retrieval is
  cheaper" without the §7 quality result and a multi-run measurement.
- **F-R7 (2026-07-23) — §7 acceptance PASSED; the real value is reliability, not a per-answer
  win.** Test question: a buried mid-page causal claim (a storage property of one product traced to
  a measured parameter of one of its components) whose source page title contains none of the
  query terms (neither the two product names nor the property words). Method: same live
  service, index present vs the bm25 `index.json` renamed aside (flips `isRetrieveProvisioned`
  per run -> legacy prompt), restored after.
  - Retrieval path (1 run): fully correct — the exact quantitative values, the
    proposed mechanism, the caveat that it is a simulation-proposed cause, and the
    escape/storage trade-off; cited the source paper AND the synthesis concept page (5 chips).
  - Legacy path (2 runs, NON-DETERMINISTIC): run 1 was a total false negative — the agent read
    hot.md + index and concluded that the vault does not cover the topic at all (it richly does:
    a whole cluster of pages), 0 citations, gave up. Run 2 succeeded well (found the source,
    8 citations).
  - Honest reading: the literal acceptance criterion (retrieval answers correctly with the right
    citation) is met. The A/B is NOT "legacy always fails" — it is that legacy is high-variance,
    gambling on whether the agent decides to drill past the hot-cache/index scan into buried
    pages, and can wrongly report absent content. Retrieval removes that gamble by seeding the
    agent with the right pages deterministically via `retrieve.py`. Value = reliability /
    reduced false-negative risk, demonstrated by example (n small), not a guaranteed better
    single answer. A statistically solid claim needs a labeled question set run many times.
- **F-R8 (2026-07-23) — post-ingest freshness verified live.** Enqueued a throwaway text note;
  it reached `done`, and ~5 min later (the scheduler's default quiet window) the debounced
  `retrieve-index` run fired automatically without any manual trigger — retrieve-index run count
  0 → 1, chunk count 859 → 860, run `done`. Cleanup note: the ingest agent judged the note to
  have no lasting value and created NO wiki page (correct), so the footprint was only `.raw/`
  manifests + `log.md` appends; reverted with two `git revert` commits. Unrelated observation
  surfaced during cleanup (NOT caused by this work, pre-dates the session — mtime 12:33): the
  vault working tree carries uncommitted pages from an earlier cursor.com blog ingest (untracked
  wiki/concepts + wiki/entities + the source page, plus modified index.md/_index.md). Flagged to
  the operator; left untouched — sweeping unrelated pages into a commit is exactly what the
  pathspec-strict commit rules forbid.
- **F-R14 (2026-09-04) — re-run at 947 pages, and the three defects it exposed.** BM25 only
  (ollama absent, so the comparison arm did not run): top-5 33/35 (94%), top-1 23/35 (66%),
  against 34/35 and 24/35 in July; the blind-random cohort stayed at 14/14. Within the
  instrument's one-case resolution, so no verdict on the baseline — but the ONE new miss was an
  `easy` case, and its cause is structural, not lexical: the expected page was the fifth DISTINCT
  page yet beyond the fifth CHUNK, because the service asked retrieve.py for five chunks and
  collapsed them to pages afterwards. Over the whole set five chunks collapsed to **4.00 pages on
  average**, so "top-5" handed the agent four. Second: generated root pages took 8 of the 175
  top-5 slots (hot.md 4, log.md 4), one of them a 53,000-word hot cache; after that cache was
  trimmed to the skill's ~500-word contract (separate PR) log.md still held its 4. Third, found
  while trimming: `contextual-prefix.py` rewrites the chunks a page still has and never deletes,
  so the trimmed hot cache kept 111 stale chunk records (51,000 words that no longer existed)
  and retrieval kept serving them; pruning took the index from 2,686 to 2,575 docs. Hit rates
  did not move with the pruning — the crowding cost slot quality, not hits. Fixes, all in this
  service's own code with the upstream scripts untouched: over-fetch chunks and cut to topK
  after the collapse; cap root pages at one slot; prune stale chunk records in the build step
  between the chunker and the indexer. The comparison arm is deferred on purpose: these fixes
  change what a measurement would measure, so measuring first would have measured the wrong
  pipeline. Re-run `npm run retrieval-eval` after they land, and grow the set past 35 before
  reading any difference between arms.

# TASKS-M1 — Pipeline

Goal (SPEC.md §10): queue, preprocessing (PDF, Office, text, image, URL), agent runner with retry/timeout, dedupe, git commits. Acceptance: 10 mixed files in `.raw` all reach `done`; no vault corruption at concurrency 2.

Work top to bottom. Check off tasks as they complete. Record findings inline under "Findings".

## 0. Carried over from M0

These are open items from `TASKS-M0.md` — not new work, but they belong here rather than in M0.

- [x] ~~Verify the language rule against a German or mixed-language source~~ — **DONE in M0** via the German consumer brochure (`046edec`). English concept names, German terms as aliases, proper nouns kept German, quotes with notes. See TASKS-M0.md §5.3.
- [x] **Make the service commit after each successful job** (SPEC.md §3.1). **DONE** — `server/src/pipeline/git.ts` + `IngestQueue.commitStep`. One commit per successful ingest, message `ingest: <source>`, authored `vault-service <vault-service@localhost>` (matching the M0 hand-made commits). Serialized behind a mutex so concurrency-2 workers don't interleave staged changes. See Finding F3/F4.
- [x] ~~Confirm the auto-commit opt-out actually holds at runtime~~ — **DONE.** The German ingest ran with the flag in place and produced **0** `wiki: auto-commit` commits (in fact 0 commits at all). Opt-out confirmed working.
- [x] **Diagnose `scripts/detect-transport.sh`.** **DONE — root cause found and fixed.** See Finding F1.
- [x] **Re-run `server/src/cli/permprobe.ts`.** **DONE (2026-07-17), passes:** `canary outside vault: blocked` (blocked by the bubblewrap sandbox — "Read-only file system"), `claude-obsidian:wiki-ingest` present as a plugin-scoped skill, 0 hook denials (as expected — the sandbox contains Bash, not the hook). Enforcement intact after all M1 changes. `npm run permprobe` added.

## 1. Spec corrections owed — APPLIED 2026-07-17 (user-approved)

All four corrections are done and committed to `SPEC.md`/`CLAUDE.md`. Kept here for the record.

- [x] **SPEC.md §3.1 + §7 table: skill loading.** Corrected: the vault is a Claude Code plugin; `settingSources: ['project']` loads only its CLAUDE.md — skills need `plugins: [{ type: 'local', path: vaultRoot }]` + `skills: 'all'`. Measured impact: 143→55 turns.
- [x] **SPEC.md §3, §4.2: `/mnt/d` does not exist** (C/M/T available). Watch-folder default corrected to `/mnt/c/inbox`.
- [x] **SPEC.md §3 note + §11.1: Obsidian over `\\wsl$` does not open at all** (`EISDIR … watch`, won't-fix), not merely "slow". Resolved via Obsidian-in-WSLg. Locking concern on drvfs is unfounded.
- [x] **CLAUDE.md hard rule 4 reworded** to match reality: OS-sandbox-enforced write scoping; `canUseTool` is not consulted (enforcement is PreToolUse hook + sandbox with `allowUnsandboxedCommands: false`); bash denylist is defense in depth, not a `scripts/*.sh` whitelist. Points at `permprobe.ts`.

## 2. Queue and job lifecycle

- [x] SQLite schema per SPEC.md §8 (`jobs`, `job_logs`, `sessions`, `messages`, `settings`, `users`), migrations, `user_id` on every new table — `server/src/db/{migrations,index,jobs}.ts`. CHECK constraints encode the state/source/type enums; DB defaults **outside** the vault (hard rule 1). `db.test.ts`.
- [x] Job states exactly `queued | preprocessing | ingesting | done | failed | deferred | duplicate | cancelled`; log every transition to `job_logs` — `JobStore.transition` validates against a transition map and writes the log line in the same SQLite transaction. `jobs.test.ts`.
- [x] Worker pool, default concurrency 2 (SPEC.md §3.1) — `IngestQueue`, `claimNextQueued` claims atomically so two workers can't double-claim. Proven at concurrency 2 (`queue.test.ts`, `queue-integration.test.ts`).
- [x] Retry: max 2 automatic retries on transient errors (API error, timeout), then `failed` with details — `classifyFailure` + retry loop; initial + 2 retries = 3 attempts max.
- [x] Dedupe by SHA-256 against `jobs.sha256` → `duplicate` — duplicate rows kept visible; the first job owns the UNIQUE hash, dupes store `sha256 = NULL` and point at the original in a log line.
- [x] Rate-limit handling: pause the queue on a usage-limit signal, auto-resume (SPEC.md §7.1) — `pauseForRateLimit` + timer resume; a pause **refunds** the attempt so it doesn't burn a retry.
- [x] Persist the agent stream to `job_logs` — `onMessage` → `formatMessage` → `job_logs` (shared with the CLI).

## 3. Preprocessing plugin chain

- [x] `detect → normalize → manifest` chain; new types are plugins, never special cases in the core — `server/src/pipeline/preprocess/`. The core (`index.ts`) never names a type. `preprocess.test.ts`, `web-preprocess.test.ts`.
- [~] **Install the toolchain.** Split by privilege: **installed now** (no sudo) — `python-pptx`/`openpyxl`/`odfpy` (pip) for the office extractor, and `defuddle` (npm) for URL extraction. **Still missing (needs sudo apt):** `pdftotext`/`pdfinfo` (poppler-utils), `ocrmypdf` + tesseract (deu+eng), `pandoc`, `exiftool`. Run **`scripts/install-preprocessing-tools.sh`** (prompts for sudo). Until then, PDF/Office-docx/image-EXIF jobs fail with a clear "tool not installed" error; text/markdown/pptx/xlsx/URL jobs already work. See Finding F2.
- [x] PDF: text extraction; OCR fallback when yield < 100 chars/page — `plugins/pdf.ts` (requires pdftotext at runtime; OCR optional).
- [x] Office (docx/pptx/xlsx), web/URL, image (EXIF + pass image to the agent), markdown/text passthrough — `plugins/{office,image,text}.ts`, `web.ts` (URL, with egress hygiene: http/https only, SSRF guard, size cap, per-hop redirect re-validation).
- [x] Audio/video → `.raw/deferred/`, status `deferred` — `plugins/deferred.ts` + `IngestQueue.deferJob`.
- [x] Magic-byte check against disguised executables; archives not auto-extracted (CLAUDE.md hard rule 6) — `detect.assertNotExecutable` runs before any plugin (ELF/PE/Mach-O/Java); `.zip` → deferred, never extracted.

## 4. Concurrency safety

- [x] 10 mixed files → all reach `done` — **proven deterministically** in `queue-integration.test.ts` (10 files, concurrency 2, real git vault + real preprocessing + real commits, faked agent). **Real end-to-end run DONE 2026-07-17** with the full toolchain against a user-supplied set of **5 mixed files** (pptx, pdf, jpg, docx, + a `.URL` web shortcut): after fixing one real bug (F6), **all 5 reach a successful outcome** (4 `done` + the URL `done` on re-run), one `ingest:` commit each, `git fsck` clean, working tree clean, pages open in Obsidian. ~17M input tokens for the four files. See Finding F6. (User chose 5 files, not 10; coverage spans office/pdf/image/web.)
- [x] No vault corruption at concurrency 2 — integration test asserts working tree clean (nothing lost), all pages in HEAD, **`git fsck` clean**, commits authored by `vault-service`. `created_pages` attribution made exact by reading it back from each commit (F3).
- [~] Explicitly test manual Claude Code use in the vault while the pipeline runs (SPEC.md §11.5) — **PARTIAL.** The real run already exercised **two parallel agent runs** against the vault (pptx + pdf ingesting simultaneously at concurrency 2) with no corruption — the vault's `wiki-lock.sh` held. What's still untested is a *human* using Claude Code interactively in the vault at the same time; that is a manual check for the user to do during an M2 watch-folder run.

## Findings

**F1 — `detect-transport.sh` hang: root cause + fix.** The script hangs because `/usr/bin/obsidian` exists on this host (Obsidian via WSLg) and the script's CLI-detection block runs `obsidian --version` (line ~134); the Electron GUI ignores `--version` and launches a window instead of exiting, so the guard `if obsidian --version` never returns (confirmed: `timeout 8 obsidian --version` → exit 124). **Fix (no vault-code change, honouring hard rule 5):** the script's *freshness check* (line ~108) `cat`s an existing `<7d` `transport.json` and `exit 0`s **before** the CLI-detection block ever runs. `.vault-meta/transport.json` was simply **absent**, so every call fell through to the hang. Wrote a pinned `.vault-meta/transport.json` (`manual_override: true`, `preferred: filesystem` — correct for a headless service with no obsidian-cli). Verified: `detect-transport.sh` now returns exit 0 in <1s. `transport.json` is gitignored/host-specific, so this is config, not a repo-internals edit. **Caveat:** the pin goes stale after 7 days (mtime), after which a write-mode call would hang again — the M2 service setup should `touch` it on start, or upstream claude-obsidian should wrap the `obsidian --version` call in `timeout`. Flag for the user.

**F2 — toolchain install is privilege-split.** See §3. The apt half needs sudo and could not be installed non-interactively; `scripts/install-preprocessing-tools.sh` does it. Also corrected: the URL extractor package is now `defuddle` (the old `defuddle-cli` merged into it); binary is `defuddle`, CLI verified (`defuddle parse <file> --md`).

**F3 — `created_pages` attribution under concurrency.** First cut computed changed pages from a pre-commit `git status` snapshot; under concurrency `git add -A` can sweep in a page written *after* the snapshot, so a page could be committed with no job recording it. Fixed: `commitVault` reads `committedPages` back from the commit itself (`git show --name-only HEAD`). Every page is committed exactly once, so the union of `committedPages` across jobs attributes every page exactly once — verified in the integration test.

**F4 — shared-commit-under-mutex (known M1 limitation, OBSERVED LIVE 2026-07-17).** Commits are serialized by a mutex. When two jobs finish within the same commit window, the first job's `git add -A` may include the second's pages, so occasionally two ingests share one commit. **Seen in the real run:** the pptx job's commit swept in the PDF's pages (a recipe concept, a publication entity, an author entity, …), so the pptx got 17 pages attributed and the PDF got 0 — even though the PDF's pages are all present and committed (under the pptx commit message). No page is ever lost and `git fsck` stays clean; only per-ingest commit *granularity* and `created_pages` counts are best-effort at concurrency 2. **Consequence for the §9 revert-undo:** a `git revert` of one ingest can also undo a co-committed sibling. Tightening this (commit only a job's own paths, or serialize commit-with-its-own-write) is a real M2/M5 follow-up — the per-file `wiki-lock.sh` already prevents actual page corruption. Recorded as an M2 candidate.

**F6 — URL job mis-routed by `source` (real-run bug, FIXED).** The M1 acceptance run failed the `.URL` shortcut job with "file job has no original_name". Root cause: `preprocessStep` discriminated URL vs file jobs on `job.source === 'url'`, but `source` is the *channel* (drop | watch | url) — a URL dropped via the CLI has source 'drop'. Fixed to discriminate on the presence of `job.url`; regression test added (`queue.test.ts`). Also added `.url`/`.webloc` shortcut unwrapping to the pipeline CLI (`pipeline/shortcut.ts`) so a dropped web shortcut becomes a URL job (SPEC.md §4.2 spirit). Re-ran the URL job after the fix → `done`.

**F5 — hot-cache refresh: note-only in M1 (CONFIRMED by user 2026-07-17).** SPEC.md §3.1 lists a per-job hot-cache refresh. M0 evidence shows the `wiki-ingest` skill *already* maintains `wiki/hot.md` as part of the ingest (M0 acceptance: "hot cache correct"). Running a *separate* refresh pass would be a second expensive agent run per job for no proven benefit. `refreshHotCache` is an injectable hook that defaults to a log note; M4 ("hot-cache refresh triggerable") can wire a real cheap trigger if one exists. User confirmed keeping the no-op hook.

**Next action (user-gated, agreed 2026-07-17):** user runs `scripts/install-preprocessing-tools.sh` (sudo); then the real 10-file end-to-end run is triggered to close M1. Until then M1 is **not** closed.

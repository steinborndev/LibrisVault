/**
 * Structural checks on `styles.css`.
 *
 * These exist because a scripted sweep over the stylesheet (2026-08-25) damaged it in two
 * ways that no type check, no unit test and no eyeball caught:
 *
 *   1. It removed the LAST line of a multi-line selector group together with its block, and
 *      left the earlier lines dangling. `.gp-search:focus-within,` then swallowed whatever
 *      came next - in one case an `@media` block - and the focus ring on every search field
 *      was silently gone.
 *   2. It removed rules whose class it had classified as unused from a list built by hand,
 *      and one of them (`.badge.queued-badge`) was still being rendered.
 *
 * The build DID warn about the first one. Nobody read it. A test does not scroll past.

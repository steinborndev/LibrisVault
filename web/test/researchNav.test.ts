/**
 * Every view of the Research screen must offer a way back to the overview.
 *
 * The screen has four: the start view, a run's detail, a conversation, and the backlog of
 * gaps. The run detail shipped with an "All runs" button; the conversation shipped with
 * nothing at all, so opening one was a one-way trip - the only routes back were the stat
 * tiles in the control column, which nobody reads as navigation (2026-08-26). The gaps view
 * is newer (2026-09-08) and had to earn the same guarantee before it could ship.
 *
 * Asserted against the source rather than a rendered tree, the way the App.tsx wiring is
 * checked next door: what matters is that the branch EXISTS, and a component test would
 * pass just as happily with the button deleted from one branch and present in another.

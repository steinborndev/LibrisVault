/**
 * The research run list (redesign 2026-08-25, second pass).
 *
 * Since schema v12 the server keeps one row per settled run (`GET /maintenance/history`),
 * which is the source of record: topic, lens, pages, tokens, cost, duration, and the failed
 * runs that never wrote a page. Three older sources still contribute, in this order:
 *
 *   history      the persistent run log - everything, for every run since v12 landed
 *   run record   the in-memory registry, which is the only one that knows about a run
 *                still IN FLIGHT
 *   settle state one restart-proof row per kind; a pre-v12 failure can only appear here
 *   vault page   topic and lens parsed back out of the deterministic
 *                `Research: <topic><lens suffix>` title, dated by mtime - this is what
 *                surfaces runs from before the run log existed
 *
 * Each source is dropped where a better one already covers the same run: by id, by claimed
 * page path, or by topic+lens within an hour of the same settle. Pure functions over plain
 * arrays (no fetching, no `Date.now()`), so the merge stays testable.

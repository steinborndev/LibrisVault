/**
 * What a finished job produced, as opposed to what it cost (2026-08-27).
 *
 * Opening a settled row used to land on the job record: timestamps, token counts, the log.
 * Those answer "did it work" - and by the time you are clicking the row you already know it
 * did, because the row said so. What you actually want is the page it wrote.
 *
 * Which page that is depends on what kind of run it was, and both kinds name it by where
 * they file it:
 *
 *   research run   `wiki/questions/Research: <topic>` - the synthesis it was started for
 *   ingest         `wiki/sources/<title>` - the source it read, whose concepts are the rest
 *
 * A run that produced neither (an index rebuild, a lint pass, a domain review) has no
 * article, and its detail opens on the log instead - which for those IS the record.
 *
 * A pure function over the page list the job already carries: no fetching, no guessing from
 * a title the agent may not have used.

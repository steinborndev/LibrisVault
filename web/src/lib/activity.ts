/**
 * The activity model behind Home (redesign 2026-08-25, second pass).
 *
 * Home and the Inbox used to describe the same events twice: a feed of cards on one screen,
 * a filterable table on the other, with two different vocabularies for the same filter. One
 * model now feeds one table, and the four kinds of thing that change a vault are equal
 * citizens in it:
 *
 *   ingest       a file, link or message became pages (a `jobs` row)
 *   research     a web-enabled run the user started on purpose
 *   maintenance  something the vault did to itself (lint, hot cache, domains, tags)
 *   edit         a commit no job or run explains: a manual page save or delete
 *
 * Pure functions over plain arrays - no fetching, no `Date.now()` inside - so the merge and
 * the windows stay unit-testable; Home feeds them from the queries it already runs.

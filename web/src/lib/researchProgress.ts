/**
 * Human-readable progress for a research run, derived from the log lines the run already
 * streams (SPEC §6.4). No new endpoint, no server bookkeeping: the agent's tool calls ARE
 * the progress signal, they were just never read as one.
 *
 * What the runner emits per SDK message (server/src/pipeline/format-message.ts):
 *
 *   [assistant] → WebSearch({"query":"..."})     a search
 *   [assistant] → WebFetch({"url":"..."})        a source being read
 *   [assistant] → Write({"file_path":"wiki/..."}) a page being filed
 *   [user] ← tool ok                             a tool returned
 *   committed abc12345 (7 page(s))               the run's single commit
 *
 * DESIGN RULE, and the reason this file is small: every number here is counted, never
 * estimated. The steps report STATE (pending / running / done); only "Read sources" gets a
 * bar, because the lens declares its fetch cap before the run starts and is therefore the
 * one phase with a real denominator. A global percentage would be invented, and a progress
 * bar that lies is worse than no progress bar.
 *
 * Limitation worth knowing: maintenance run logs stream but are not persisted, so a reload
 * mid-run starts from an empty buffer and the steps re-fill as new lines arrive (seconds,
 * on a run that logs continuously). The run itself is unaffected.

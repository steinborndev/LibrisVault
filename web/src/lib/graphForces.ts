 * one coherent blob held NEAR its neighbors by its bridges, not inside them.
 *
 * Grouping is by the pages' `domain:` frontmatter, NOT by the detected Louvain communities:
 * domains are stable metadata available on every layout (communities are only computed while

 * visible edges are domain-internal, so the graph is ~17 near-disconnected components with
 * no link forces between them, and `forceManyBody.distanceMax` truncates repulsion at a
 * range smaller than the largest blob is wide. Nothing forbade two domains from occupying
 * the same space, and a force layout that starts interleaved stays interleaved.
 *
 * So the layout is two-level now. Level 1 (here) treats each domain as ONE disc whose radius
 * follows its member count and packs those discs without overlap; level 2 (the node
 * simulation) pulls every page toward its domain's assigned slot instead of a floating
 * centroid. Disjointness becomes a property of the arrangement rather than a hoped-for
 * side effect.

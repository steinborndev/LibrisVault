/**
 * Canvas renderer for the vault graph (SPEC.md §12.4). Canvas 2D, not SVG - an SVG DOM node
 * per page is exactly what makes graph views fall over as a vault grows; a single canvas
 * draws tens of thousands of nodes without breaking a sweat. Layout comes from the d3-force
 * web worker (lib/graphLayout.worker.ts), so the UI thread only ever draws.
 *
 * Scale-mindedness, deliberately built in from the start (the vault will keep growing):
 *   - label level-of-detail: at low zoom only hub labels draw, zooming in reveals the rest
 *   - viewport culling: off-screen nodes/labels are skipped
 *   - the simulation cools and stops; re-layout only when the node set actually changes
 *   - hover/click hit-testing is O(n) over a typed array - fine far beyond 10k nodes
 *
 * Live updates (SPEC.md §12.4): positions are keyed by page PATH, not by array index - the
 * server sorts nodes by path, so one new page shifts every index after it. When the node set
 * changes (vault SSE event mid-ingest, filter toggle, local mode), known pages keep their
 * place and the simulation re-heats gently instead of being thrown away; brand-new pages
 * appear at their neighbors' centroid and flash briefly. The camera NEVER moves on a live
 * update - auto-fit happens only on the very first layout.

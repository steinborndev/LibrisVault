/**
 * One figure with its label: a caption, the number, and an optional line of context under
 * it. Home's glance strip and System's fact grids were two implementations of exactly this,
 * with the same `.k` / `.v` / `.s` markup and six values drifted apart between them (value
 * 20 vs 16px, sub 11.5 vs 11px, padding 14 vs 12px, and so on).
 *
 * They keep their two densities, because they are doing different jobs: `lead` is Home's
 * strip of five doors across the top of the screen, `default` is a dense grid of a dozen
 * numbers inside a section. That is a size, not a second component.
 *
 * With `onOpen` the tile is a button and says where it goes; without it, it is a `div` and
 * takes no tab stop, because a figure nobody can act on should not be in the tab order.
